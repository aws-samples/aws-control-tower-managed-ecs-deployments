## aws control tower managed ecs deployments


This sample code achieves a continuous application deployment on ECS within the Control Tower environment, which will make it easier for new account to get integrated with existing account which host container registry and deployment pipelines.   
Refer to [Control Tower Workshop](https://controltower.aws-management.tools/deployment/ecs-deploy/) for detailed guide.

As this sample primarily focus on Control tower, we are reusing the [php simple application](https://github.com/aws-samples/ecs-demo-php-simple-app) available in aws-samples github org for application deployment purpose.
